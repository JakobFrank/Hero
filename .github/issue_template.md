Note that this structure, while highly recommended, is not mandatory. Feel free to
write your issue in a different format if it is more suitable.

Delete all sections not relevant to your issue, and the top-level heading for your
issue, before submitting.

Also make sure that, if relevant, your issue title starts with one of the following
tags:

 - [BUG]

 - [FEATURE]

 - [QUESTION]

# For bugs

## What I did

## What I expected to happen

## What actually happened

## What priority fixing this should be, in my opinion

# For feature requests

## What the feature should be

## How this feature should be triggered

## Why this feature should be added

## What priority adding this should be, in my conservative opinion

# Questions do not need structure
